# Tkinter-Practice

This repository is majorly what ushered me into Tkinter. For the longest time, I've been studying Python in all its beauty, however I realized, I haven't actually done stuffs with it. So I went online and learnt how to use its graphic user interface, Tkinter. Its a cool one though. not too fashionable, not as HTML and CSS would have presented their own kind of interface, but it's a cool one from python. Cheers.
